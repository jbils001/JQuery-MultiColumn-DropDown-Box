# JQuery-MultiColumn-DropDown-Box

This JQuery plug-in transforms a specified <div> into a configurable multiple column dropdown box based on Twitter Bootstrap for formatting, which is useful when there is more than a simple list of values. The configuration shown in Example 1 and 2 demonstrate the default behavior of the plug-in, whereby the size flexâ€™s to the container and the selected row returns a concatenation of the columns.
